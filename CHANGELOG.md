# Changelog

All notable changes to unitati are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): while the product is pre-1.0,
minor bumps carry features and patch bumps carry fixes.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- `vite build` no longer requires `DATABASE_URL`. Building analyses the app without opening a
  connection, so environments that legitimately have no database credentials (CI, image builds)
  can build it. The variable is still mandatory when the app starts.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Evaluation docs: vision, alternatives, domain model, MVP scope, internal vs open source decision.
- ADR 0001 (stack and architecture), ADR 0002 (server modules by domain), ADR 0003 (SemVer and changelog).
- SvelteKit 3 + Svelte 5 + TypeScript scaffold with Tailwind CSS 4, Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL 17 (`compose.yaml`).
- Domain folders under `src/lib/server/` and the shared `Outcome` type.
- Running version injected at build time and shown in the app shell and on the login screen.
- Version-bump CI gate (`scripts/check-version-bump.mjs`) and GitHub Actions workflow.
